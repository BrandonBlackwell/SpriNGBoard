1:
- Line 1 is displaying the address of x
- Line 2 is displaying the address of x's alias rx
- Line 3 is displaying the address of x's const alias crx.

2:
- The output values are all the same because they are referencing the same string object or variable.There is only one string object is this program.

3:
- x is non-const before line 6. When line 6 runs x becomes const because of the reference crx and then appended to which makes no sense because x is now const which means it is immutable so, it can't be modified.
