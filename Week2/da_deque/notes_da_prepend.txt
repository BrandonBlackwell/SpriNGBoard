Observations:
- Index 0 - 2 takes longer to prepend.
- Index 4 also takes longer to prepend.
- Index 8 takes longer.
- Index 16 takes longer.
- Index 32 takes longer.
- Index 64 takes longer.
- Index 128 takes longer.
- Index 256 takes longer.
- Index 512 takes longer.
- Index 1024 takes longer.
etc...

- Although it still takes longer at the powers of 2 points, every iteration takes much longer to prepend than appending.
- Which makes sense because prepending to a dynamic array takes O(n) time. It has allocate memory at every index.
