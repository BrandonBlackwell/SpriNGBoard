Observations:
- The code is timing how long it takes to append an item(from 0 - 9999) every iteration in nanoseconds. It repeats this 5 times. 
- Index 0 - 2 takes longer to append.
- Index 4 also takes longer to append.
- Index 8 takes longer.
- Index 16 takes longer.
- Index 32 takes longer.
- Index 64 takes longer.
- Index 128 takes longer.
- Index 256 takes longer.
- Index 512 takes longer.
- Index 1024 takes longer.
etc...

- There is a pattern here. Looks like powers of 2.
- I'm assuming the dynamic array is reallocating space at these points which slows the time down.
