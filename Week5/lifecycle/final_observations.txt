Regular objects:
 The lifetime of the objects created in main die when main ends. Except o_7, it's
 created in main and dies when it's contents are stolen using the move constructor. 



Vector Section:
  - When using "noexcept" the move constructor is used to transfer the 
  objects data.
  - Without noexcept most objects data are copied except "v_1[1]" because 
  of the "push_back" method, the move constructor is used to move the data.
  The other objects are copied then appended to the vector using "emplace_back".
  (Note to self) So, if I use emplace_back to append an item and then try
  to move the item, it will be moved with the copy constructor. If I use 
  the push_back method and try to move it, the move constructor will be 
  used.



Pointer Section:
  Outer Scope up_1(id:20),sp_1(id:21)
  Inner Scope = up_2(id:22), up_3, sp_2(id:23)
  - up_1(id:20) is created in the outer scope and dies in the inner scope.
  - sp_1(id:21) is created in the outer scope and dies after sp_2 is assigned
  to it.
  - up_2(id:22) is created on the inner scope and dies when the inner scope ends. 
  - sp_2(id:23) is created in the inner scope and dies when outside of outer scope.
