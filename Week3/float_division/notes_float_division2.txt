Observations:
- The code now produces results for all integer num/denom division.
- The results are floating point types in scientific notation.
- So, because the type for numerators are float's the results are converted to float
because of the fractional part.
- An interesting thing happens when the denominator is 0. 
The result of dividing the numerator by 0 becomes a -inf, -nan at 0, +inf.
